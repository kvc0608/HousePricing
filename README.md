## General Information
- Undersstand the key features helpful for predicting the sale price
- Linear regression is used
- Lasso and ridge regularization is used to prevent overfitting
- Based on dataset from Surprise Housing

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- Top 5 features found are: OverallQual,GrLivArea,GarageCars,ExterQual_Gd,Fireplaces
- Multi collinearity between the features was checked
- Assumptions of linear regression were validated
